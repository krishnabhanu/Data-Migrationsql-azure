In order to migrate data from a MySQL server to SQL server in Azure Blob Storage, I created a resource group and storage account to store the data. Today, I set up integrated services and installed the necessary software on my PC. To enable automated data migration, I established a connection between the cloud and my PC using the provided keys. 

To facilitate the data migration process, I created a pipeline that connects to the on-premise data, which was stored on my PC. Using this pipeline, I established a connection for each table from source to sink and stored the data in CSV format. Finally, I added triggers that allow for the import to be automatically scheduled in Data Factory. 

By following these steps and utilizing Data Factory, I have been able to streamline the data migration process and ensure that it is completed on schedule and with minimal issues.
